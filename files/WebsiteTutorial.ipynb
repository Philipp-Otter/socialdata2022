    "[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an essential tool for anyone who works with data or code. It makes it easy to keep various versions of your code, collaborate with other people on the same code, etc., as for instance with [GitHub](https://github.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will rely on GitHub for hosting our website, it's a good idea to go through a brief introduction to git and GitHub in case you're not familiar with them: [this tutorial](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners) should provide a good starting point.\n"

You can find some information on how to do this [here](https://bwaycer.github.io/hugo_tutorial.hugo/tutorials/github-pages-blog/): we'll detail the first alternative from that tutorial, but if you're comfortable with git, we suggest trying the second alternative as it is more flexible.\n",
